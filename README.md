I want to be a data analystic

*I am interested in data science because it allows to observe patterns and, by doing so, helping people.*

### My code tells if a number is even or odd.



 
```python
def odd_even(x):
    if x % 2 == 0 :
      print("Even")
    else:
      print("Odd")
      
odd_even(3) # it prints "Odd"

```

1. First item 
2. Second item

- First item
- Second item

~~The number 2 is odd.~~ This appears striketrough because it's wrong.
